# Maze Quest AI

An interactive Maze Quest AI game built with Python and pygame.

## Features

- AI agent navigates a maze to collect food pellets.
- Multiple pathfinding algorithms: BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, GBFS.
- Maze layout is a proper puzzle with static walls and hurdles.
- Dynamic UI with Stop/Restart controls.
- Score and step tracking, with result comparison after algorithm switch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pygame

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


2. Activate the environment:

- On Windows (cmd):

venv\Scripts\activate


3. Install dependencies:

pip install pygame


## Running

Run the main program with:

python main.py


Use keys 1-5 to switch algorithms:

- 1: BFS
- 2: DFS
- 3: UCS
- 4: A*
- 5: GBFS

Controls:

- S: Stop/Pause simulation
- R: Restart simulation

Enjoy!
